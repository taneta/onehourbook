# One Hour Book
## Project web page - http://onehourbook.ru/

Hi, this is the repository of the OneHourBook project.

The idea of the project is to write a collaborative book where every chapter is an hour from somebody's life. 
The chapters were submitted anonymously with no restriction on the text content or length.

Last year we collected 38 hours written by Russian-speaking participants.
In 2019, the project will be announced in other countries as well.
